# WaPoll: Decentralized Polling with Waku

## Overview
WaPoll is an interactive workshop project showcasing the power and flexibility of Waku, a peer-to-peer messaging protocol. This project demonstrates a decentralized polling application where users can vote on various options, and the results are communicated across a distributed network using Waku. The primary objective is to illustrate the practical implementation of decentralized communication systems in a simple, user-friendly manner.

## Features
Decentralized Voting: Leverage the decentralized nature of Waku to conduct polls.
Real-Time Updates: See live voting results as they are broadcasted over the Waku network.
Simple UI: User-friendly interface built with React and styled using TailwindCSS.
Workshop-Friendly: Ideal for educational purposes, workshops, and demonstrations of P2P technology.
Prerequisites
Before running the WaPoll application, ensure you have the following installed:

## Deployed
You can access the deployed version of WaPoll at https://wa-poll.vercel.app/.


## How It Works
WaPoll uses Waku to create a decentralized network where users can submit votes on a poll. The votes are then broadcasted to all peers in the network. The application showcases:

- Creating a Waku node in a web environment.
- Sending messages (votes) over the Waku network.
- Receiving and aggregating votes from the network.
